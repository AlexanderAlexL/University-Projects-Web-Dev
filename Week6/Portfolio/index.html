                    <p>If you need a website but you don't know where to start, then you'll probably need UX and UI
                        design to plan the Wireframes/prototypes, archtecture and also the visual design, colors and
                        typography of your website. I can help you with this. I use Figma for the design process at this
                        stage but I am familiar with other wireframing and prototyping design tools too. Web design is
                        an important part for delivering the right message to your customers.

                    <p>Following the web design, I implement the design into code. For the front-end development I like
                        using free-hand code such as vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript because of the unlimited
                        opportunities with free-hand code. However, I am familiar with CSS frameworks and JS libraries
                        such as Bootstrap, ReactJS (in progress). If your preference is a WordPress based website,
                        I can help you with that too. Currently, I am focusing on the front-end development.

                        Search Engine Ranking Pages. One of the most importants search engines is Google. SEO is a

                    All kind of images, svg files can be animated by CSS and JavaScript and these implemented in the web

                    implement rules for user registration and we can verify the different input fields automatically to
                    increase the compliance with the security rules of the company.

                    different layers of vector graphics within this project and these are animated using CSS animation,
                    keyframes and sprite sheets.

                    but in my freetime I try to soak in the knowledge of web development. I love the creativity and
                    limitless opportunities in the design and development process. <br><br><strong>Contact me if you

                <h4>Bath Spa University: Web Development</h4>
                <p>
                    I am studying full-stack web development at Bath Spa University's Bootcamp. This enables me to
                    design
                    and develop both front-end and back-end applications. Please, see the technologies I use in the next
                    box.
                </p>
                <h4>Northumbria University: MSc Psychology</h4>
                <p>
                    Many people are surprised when they hear how important is Psychology in web development. Knowing
                    the way
                    people think is essential not only in Cognitive Psychology but also in UX/UI design and in
                    digital
                    marketing. I can use my knowledge in Cognitive Psychology and the Principles of Gestalt
                    Psychology to
                    develop more effective projects.
                </p>
                <h4>Kodolanyi Janos University: BSc Economics</h4>
                <p>
                    Studying Economics and working for multinational corporates in the last few years helps me
                    better
                    understand the needs of business clients.

                <h4>Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (ReactJS, GSAP, SCSS in progress)</h4>
                <p>
                    Front-end development I use free-handed code of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I am also familiar with
                    Bootstrap but I prefer the unlimited possibilities of vanilla code. I am working on my knowledge of
                    GSAP and SCSS too. For UX/UI design I use Figma but familiar with Just-in-Mind too.
                </p>
                <h4>Back-end Development (in progress): NodeJS, PHP, MySQL</h4>
                <p>
                    My studies in server-side development are in progress. The main focus rightnow is NodeJS but
                    because I am working on WordPress sites for some clients PHP and MySQL studies are coming soon.
                </p>
                <h4>WordPress</h4>
                <p>
                    I am familiar with WordPress Development and Divi. Considering that WordPress is one of the
                    most popular CMS I wish to continue to offer WordPress sites if it better fits for my
                    Clients. PHP and MySQL studies are coming soon for back-end dev.

                    I am familiar with several keyword research tools such as SemRush, Ubersuggest, Moz. Keyword
                    Research is
                    important for digital marketing and Google Ads. I can help you in keyword research for your campaign

                <p>
                    There are some technical principles for higher SERP ranking and I am familiar with these and
                    actively
                    implementing them in my development process (e.g. importance of https, disadvantage of duplicate
